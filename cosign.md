# sigstore/cosign

As part of my job working on cert-manager, I [added a flag](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/1071) which allowed
users who're forced to used different signing hash algorithms when signing to be able to validate those signatures later,
effectively fixing a bug and adding a feature.
